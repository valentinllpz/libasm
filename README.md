# Libasm

A project in assembly that used a [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) common core project. It aims to make us discover what is assembly (nasm) and how very low level programming works. I personally really enjoyed this project because it also pushed me to go further and understand better how the CPU works.

I made a [tester](https://github.com/valentinllpz/Libasm_Unit_Tests) to help other students to work on this project.
